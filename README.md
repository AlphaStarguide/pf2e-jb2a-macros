# pf2e-jb2a-macros
A collection of JB2A macros for the PF2e Foundry system.

Created to accompany the Community Complete Autorec for [Automated Animations](https://github.com/otigon/automated-jb2a-animations).

**Requires JB2A Assets modules. Built primarily for the _Patreon_ version.** Full compatibility with the Free version is on the To-Do list, but not a priority.

You can probably appropriate most of this module for other systems, I simply don't have interest in doing so.

## Installing the module

The basics of installing and enabling the module can be found [here](https://foundryvtt.com/article/modules/). 

Beyond that, this module is created to accompany the **PF2e Community Complete Autorec** file, which can be downloaded by pressing [this](https://github.com/MrVauxs/pf2e-jb2a-macros/releases/latest/download/autorec.json) hyperlink.

Once downloaded, head over to the Automated Animations settings and Configure Automatic Recognition.

At the bottom of the menu, you have **Overwrite / Merge Menu**. This is where you input the file.

If you haven't created any effects of your own, I recommend Overwriting. If you have made your own animations, note that Overriding is going to delete those entries, so instead use Merge. The How-To on updating _existing_ entries can be found below in [Updating the Autorecognition Settings](https://github.com/MrVauxs/pf2e-jb2a-macros/blob/main/README.md#updating-the-autorecognition-settings).

And that's it!

Hopefully in the future automatic merging / overwriting of AA's autorec settings will be possible, but currently it is manual.

### Updating the Autorecognition Settings
If you want to keep your own custom effects, you can update your existing settings without losing your custom ones by doing the following:
1. **Export** your existing menu to a separate file
2. **Override** the menu in Foundry with the new PF2e x JB2A autorec file
3. **Merge** the newly overriden menu with your exported file
