# pf2e-jb2a-macros
A collection of JB2A macros for the PF2e Foundry system.

Created to accompany the Community Complete Autorec for [Automated Animations](https://github.com/otigon/automated-jb2a-animations).
The **autorec file** can be found [here](https://github.com/MrVauxs/pf2e-jb2a-macros/blob/main/autorec.json).

### Updating the Autorecognition Settings
If you have created custom effects, you can update your existing settings without losing your custom ones by doing the following:
1. **Export** your existing menu to a separate file
2. **Override** the menu in Foundry with the new PF2e x JB2A autorec file
3. **Merge** the newly overriden menu with your exported file
